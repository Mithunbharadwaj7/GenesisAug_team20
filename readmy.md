# Basic Gates

**AND GATE**                   

And gate is the one which gives an high output if all the inputs are high

**OR GATE**

Or gate is a circuit which gives a high output if one or more of its inputs are high

**NOT GATES**

The NOT gate is a circuit which produces at its output the negated version of its input logic

# UNIVERSAL GATES

**NAND GATE**

The NAND gate is a NOT-AND circuit which is equivalent to an AND circuit followed by a NOT circuit. The output of the NAND gate is high if any of its inputs is low.
